============

This is a pre-built Ubuntu-based distro created especially for Android Developers and new users that want
to learn how to ROM (hellskitchen). It is still in very early development. It is best used as a live USB installation.
It can be instaled to a local hard drive, or in a virtual machine as well. It has been tested and does not work well
with new video cards and some motherboards.

Please be kind. It is in early development.
